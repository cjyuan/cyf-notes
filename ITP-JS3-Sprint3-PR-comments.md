### Generic

We should always respect instructions like `DO NOT EDIT BELOW HERE`; it is usually there for a good reason. If you are curious about why, you can ask ChatGPT `Why should programmers respect "DO NOT EDIT BELOW HERE" instruction in a file?`


### Alarmclock App

If a user enters a time and then clicks the "Set Alarm" button multiple times, the countdown clock will not display properly.
Can you fix the problem?

### Quote Generator

#### Sprint-3/quote-generator/quotes.js
Code is good, 

The first line in `quote.js` is `// DO NOT EDIT BELOW HERE`. So you probably should insert your code before that line.

It would be better to show "Auto-Play: OFF" initially (to be consistent with the unchecked "Auto-Play" checkbox).

### Image Carousel

- Not all the requirements specified in "Level 1 Challenge" in `readm.md` are met.

- If a user clicks the "Auto forward" or/and "Auto Backward" **multiple** times, the display will become jittery, and clicking the "Stop" button cannot stop the images from being changed automatically.
