#### Sprint-1/errors/3.js
If you cannot modify this statement `const cardNumber = 4533787178994213;`
(that is, keep the variable's value unchanged), 
how would you modify the code so that it can still extract the last 4 digits from its value.

#### Sprint-1/errors/4.js
Have you also noticed the variable names do not quite match the values assigned to the variable?

#### Sprint-1/exercises/decimal.js
If you run the program, you may notice that `console.log()` outputs the value of `decimalPart` 
with more than 4 decimal places (which is normal because of floating point arithmetic). 

If you were asked to print the value of `decimalPart` to exactly 4 decimal places,
how would you modify the code?

#### Sprint-1/exercises/paths.js



#### Sprint-1/exercises/random.js
To test your understanding, how would you write an expression 
(without using any variable in the expression) that yields a random 
integer between -5 and 3 (including -5 and 3)?

The phrase "between 0 and 1" alone is not precise enough in program specification because 
it does not state clearly whether 0 and 1 are included in the range.

May I suggest asking ChatGPT how to precisely describe a range of numbers from 0 to 1 
that include/exclude 0/1, and then use what you learn to describe the return value of 
`Math.random()`?

#### Sprint-1/interpret/to-pounds.js
 Can we expect this program to work as intended even if we deleted `.padEnd(2, "0")` from the code?

If you were writing a program that uses `prompt()` to ask for an input value, how can 
your program tell if the user clicked "OK" or "Cancel"?

There is a shorter ***programming term*** to describe operations like `count = count + 1` or `count++`. 
May I suggest feeding the code to ChatGPT to see how else the code can be described? 
From time to time you may learn new terminology or more concise ways to describe code.
