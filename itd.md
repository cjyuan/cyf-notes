### Step 0

The screenshot you submitted does not meet all the acceptance criteria specified in https://itd.codeyourfuture.io/steps/zero/#acceptance-criteria.

---
The screenshot you shared was not taken in the channel stated in the acceptance criteria: https://itd.codeyourfuture.io/steps/zero/#acceptance-criteria

Can you share another screenshot showing your message that was posted in the #introduce-yourself-to-codeyourfuture channel on the ITD Slack Workspace?

### Step 1

The file you uploaded does not quite meet the acceptance criteria (https://itd.codeyourfuture.io/steps/one/#acceptance-criteria).  
Please submit a PDF file that includes your name, your score, and your answers. 

Suggestion: Google search  
How to print a webpage to a PDF file using **YOUR_BROWSER_NAME** browser on **YOUR_DEVICE_NAME**.

---
A minimal score of 25/30 is needed in this exercise.  
Can you retry the exercise until your score is at least 25/30, and then resubmit a PDF file saved from the Score Summary Page? Thanks.

---
### Step 2

Can you grant public "Viewer" permission to your Google Doc and resubmit its link. 

Suggestion: Look up  
How to grant public viewer permission to a Google Doc.

---
The instructions also request, for each answer, write one to three sentences explaining why you chose the answer.

Can you add the explanation and resubmit your Google Doc link?

---
Please note that for question 3, there are more than one inappropriate responses.

---
I am having trouble reviewing your document because the text direction is set to right-to-left.  
Could you please change the document's formatting to left-to-right and resubmit the link?  
You can usually find this option in the formatting or text settings menu.
Thanks!

### Step 3

Can you grant public "Viewer" permission to the Google sheet and resubmit the link. Otherwise we cannot view its content.

---
The second filter condition, "Date is between 1 June 2024 and 31 December 2024", is not quite implemented correctly. 


---
Your Google Sheet does not show the filtered results. (Item 9 in the instructions)  
It’s possible that you used temporary filters instead of permanent filters.  
If that’s the case, you may want to **look up how to apply filters in Google Sheets** so the filtered view can be shared with other users.

### Step 4
The page looks great. 

Why set the font size of H1 element using JavaScript (instead of using CSS)?

---
### Step 5

One of the acceptance criteria (https://itd.codeyourfuture.io/steps/five/#acceptance-criteria) has not yet been met:  
- The URL of the deployed webpage includes your first name, last name, or both.

Can you address this issue and resubmit your GitHub Pages link?

### Step 6 

When I clicked the link to your conversation with an AI page, I could not see your conversation.  
Can you use an AI tool to figure out why others cannot view your conversation when they open that link, and address the issue?
