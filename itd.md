Please note that the ITD which started on 1 Sep will end at 23:59pm on 28 Sep.
If you cannot finish all steps by the deadline, you can join the next ITD which starts on 1 Nov and reuse your solutions.


### Step 0

The screenshot you submitted does not meet all the acceptance criteria specified in https://itd.codeyourfuture.io/steps/zero/#acceptance-criteria.

---
The screenshot you shared was not taken in the channel stated in the acceptance criteria: https://itd.codeyourfuture.io/steps/zero/#acceptance-criteria

Can you share another screenshot showing your message that was posted in the #introduce-yourself-to-codeyourfuture channel on the ITD Slack Workspace?

---
### Step 1

The file you uploaded does not quite meet the acceptance criteria (https://itd.codeyourfuture.io/steps/one/#acceptance-criteria).  
Please submit a PDF file that includes your name, your score, and your answers. 

Suggestion: Google search  
How to print a webpage to a PDF file using **YOUR_BROWSER_NAME** browser on **YOUR_DEVICE_NAME**.

---
A minimal score of 25/30 is needed in this exercise.  
Can you retry the exercise until your score is at least 25/30, and then resubmit a PDF file saved from the Score Summary Page? Thanks.

---
### Step 2

Can you grant public "Viewer" permission to your Google Doc and resubmit its link. 

Suggestion: Look up  
How to grant public viewer permission to a Google Doc.

---
The instructions also request, for each answer, write one to three sentences explaining why you chose the answer.

Can you add the explanation and resubmit your Google Doc link?

---
Please note that for question 3, there are more than one inappropriate responses.

---
I am having trouble reviewing your document because the text direction is set to right-to-left.  
Could you please change the document's formatting to left-to-right and resubmit the link?  
You can usually find this option in the formatting or text settings menu.
Thanks!

---
### Step 3

Can you grant public "Viewer" permission to the Google sheet and resubmit the link. Otherwise we cannot view its content.

---
The second filter condition, "Date is between 1 June 2024 and 31 December 2024", is not quite implemented correctly. 

Please note that the dates are in UK format `DD/MM/YYYY`, not in US format `MM/DD/YYYY`.

---
Your Google Sheet does not show the filtered results. (Item 9 in the instructions)  
It’s possible that you used temporary filters instead of permanent filters.  
If that’s the case, you may want to **look up how to apply filters in Google Sheets** so the filtered view can be shared with other users.

---
The filtering condition on the **Date** column was not set up correctly. Only sales made between **1 June 2024 and 31 Dec 2024** should be displayed.

---
If filters are applied only to the "Date" and "Point of Sale" columns, reordering will affect only those two columns, while the corresponding data in the other columns will remain unchanged and misaligned.

However, if filters are applied to all relevant columns, then reordering ensures that the data across all columns remains properly aligned.

---
You missed implementing these filtering criteria:
  - Condition 2: Date is between 1 June 2024 and 31 December 2024
- Use a filter to order the rows by Date in ascending order

---
You applied the filters to the wrong row. Consequently, the headers were also filtered out.

---
The requirements shown in this image (item 9 in the instructions) were not implemented properly.  
<img width="660" height="153" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/516ac924-7641-4527-a5f2-6a02de6b69af" />

Can you **setup the filters** so that your sheet shows only 12 rows of data, similar to those shown in the sample output?

---
The filter condition, "Date is between 1 June 2024 and 31 December 2024", was not set properly.

Suggestion:
Instead of filtering the dates by values, we can filter the dates **by condition** and use the condition **is between** to specify dates between 1 June 2024 and 31 Dec 2024.


---

If you cannot figure out how to fix the issue, you can try showing your CodePen link to an AI tool and ask it the relevant questions.


---
### Step 4
The page looks great. 

Why set the font size of H1 element using JavaScript (instead of using CSS)?

---

There are errors in your HTML and CSS code. 

Can you fix all the errors and resubmit your CodePen link?


---

- The images are not displaying properly. You may want to check each image URL to ensure it points to a **publicly** accessible **image** (and not a webpage).
- There are errors in your HTML and CSS code. You can use CodePen's "HTML Analyzer" and "CSS Analyzer" to check for issues.
- The requirement that "one of the images must be centered horizontally on the page" has not yet been met.

Can you address these issues and resubmit your CodePen link?

### Step 5

One of the acceptance criteria (https://itd.codeyourfuture.io/steps/five/#acceptance-criteria) has not yet been met:  
- The URL of the deployed webpage includes your first name, last name, or both.

Can you address this issue and resubmit your GitHub Pages link?


---
### Step 6 

When I clicked the link to your conversation with an AI page, I could not see your conversation.  
There is a chance that the saved conversation is not publicly accessible.
Can you address the issue?


---
When I clicked the CodePen link, I could not see any CSS code. Did you forget to save your code on CodePen?

---
In your Google Doc, can you also include your answers to these two questions and add one to three sentences explaining why you chose the answers you did?
  - Do you understand it all?
  - Has any of the code been pasted from an AI tools or elsewhere?

---
When I clicked the link to your conversation with an AI page, I get an error message "Unable to load conversation ...".  
Can you use an AI tool to figure out why others cannot view your conversation when they open that link, and address the issue?
