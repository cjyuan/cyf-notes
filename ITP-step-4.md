  - Share the screenshot of your LinkedIn Social Selling Index

The LinkedIn SSI task asks only for ONE action written in a SMART way. You listed so many and I am not sure how you plan to achieve all in the near future.
A SMART action should be Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound.
Can you express one action that satisfies these five characteristics?


- Specific: The action is clearly defined and easy to understand
- Measurable: The action can be measured, so you can track your progress
- Achievable: The action is realistic and feasible
- Relevant: The action is meaningful and fits the purpose of your goal
- Time-bound: The action has a deadline


Volunteers don't receive any email notification when you leave comments here on the Applicant Portal.
Can you make a new submission after you have made the necessary change? Doing so would make your submission "stand out" on Dashboard to attract volunteer's attention.
