### What is a Pull Request (PR)?

A pull request, often called a PR, is a way for developers to propose changes to a codebase.
Think of it as saying: "Hey, I've made some updates — can we review them together before they become part of the main project?"

A pull request, or PR, is a way to share your code for review. In many companies, PRs are used to suggest changes and then merge them into the main project.

At CodeYourFuture, we use PRs a little differently:

The goal is review, not merging. You’ll create a PR so that mentors and teammates can look at your code and give you feedback.

Think of it like handing in an assignment. The PR is the place where you “submit” your work so others can check it, comment on it, and help you improve.

Merging won’t happen. Instead, you’ll take the feedback, update your code, and learn from the process.


CodeYourFuture, when submitting 

When you open a PR, you’re not just sharing code -- you’re starting a conversation. A PR lets a CYF mentor:
- See what you changed (new code, fixes, or features).
- Discuss the changes (through comments, suggestions, or questions).
- Approve or request improvements before merging into the main branch.



### What does it mean to submit a PR
- Request a review of changes made in a branch when compared to a target branch (before the changes is merged into the target branch, if needed).
  - PRs submitted in CYF coursework will only be reviewed but not merged into CYF repo.
  - The target branch in CYF is typically the `main` branch.
