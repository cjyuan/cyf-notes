VSCode includes a built-in feature called "Format Document" which can be used to format our code for better readability and consistency.
To use the feature, right-click inside the code editor and select the option.

It's a good practice to use an [HTML validator](https://validator.w3.org/) to check our HTML code for errors and ensure it follows web standards.

It is also good practice to use an AI tool to review our code. It can often provide valuable feedback and help identify small mistakes we might overlook.

On a separate note, it is best practice to include a brief description in the Changelist section of every PR.


Line 17 can be better formatted as:
```
    <p>
      A README file is a document that provides information about a project,
      including its purpose, how to install and use it, and any other
      relevant details. It serves as a guide for users and developers to
      understand the project.
    </p>
```

To understand why, you can ask ChatGPT these questions:
- How HTML treat mutliple whitespace characters in text?
- What's the advantage of not writing a long paragraph of text in a single line in HTML?
