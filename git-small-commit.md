Why not practice **committing files one by one**? Making small commits has the following advantages:
- **Clarity**: Each commit tells a clear story (one feature, one fix, one change).
- **Debugging**: Easy to find and undo the commit that caused a bug.
- **Collaboration**: Teammates can review and understand changes faster.
- **History**: Project log becomes a readable timeline, not a messy dump.
- **Safety**: Progress is saved in safe, logical stepsâ€”less risk of losing work.

If you would like to practice **committing files one by one** in VSCode, you can select which file to stage and then commit only the staged file.
See: [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5jZ9lrSpqk&t=705) (at around the 12:50 mark, it shows how to stage a single file).

If you prefer using the `git` command (which most professionals do), the [W3School Git Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/git/default.asp?remote=github)
 is a good place to start.
