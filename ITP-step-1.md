Please follow the instructions in https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/Module-Onboarding/issues/570 to prepare what you need to submit on the Course Platform.


The issue you created is valid, but your PRs have not yet completed their reviews.

Please resubmit the same issue link once both PRs have passed review and have been marked with the "Complete" label by the reviewer.


Your PRs do not have the "Needs review" label. As such, they are not likely to be reviewed by the volunteers.


---
When your PR is ready for review (including after you’ve addressed the reviewer’s feedback), update its label from “Reviewed” to “Needs review”. Once the reviewer accepts your changes, they will apply the “Complete” label to the PR.
