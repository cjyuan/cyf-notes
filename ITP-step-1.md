The new way (starting ITP-Jan) to submit PRs (according to the acceptance criteria) is

The acceptance criteria in step 1 asks for
1. Make a new issue on your own Coursework Planner repository
2. Include both of your pull request (PR) links in the issue
3. Submit the issue link

Here is a suggested format for the PR links:
```
  Wireframe PR
  https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/Module-Onboarding/pull/<PR number>

  Form-Control PR
  https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/Module-Onboarding/pull/<PR number>
```

Can you make a new issue in your Coursework Planner repo, add your PR links in a comment of the issue, and then submit your issue link?

Note: To create a new issue, click "Issues" tab in your own Coursework Planner repository and then create a new issue.
