#### Sprint-2/1-key-errors/1.js
With the current implementation, the function will always return "50%".
How would you modify the function so that it can be easily reused to convert different numbers to their equivalent percentages? 


#### Sprint-2/2-mandatory-debug/2.js
May I suggest asking ChatGPT "How does identifier resolution work in Javascript?".

#### Sprint-2/3-mandatory-implement/1-bmi.js
What type of value do you expect the function to return? A number or a string?
Is your implementation matches your expectation?
